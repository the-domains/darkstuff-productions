We would like to invite you to a water bound evening of chaos, confetti and cake aboard Bristol Ferry's MATILDA. Step aboard for a theatrical journey up the Avon as a guest at the wedding reception from hell! As the drinks flow and the speeches over-run a newlyweds' big night hits choppy waters when four attendees not only rock the boat but threaten to capsize the whole wedding reception.

A darkly comic new play packed with drunken speeches, bad singing and some truly terrible behaviour..

Darkstuff returns to Bristol with it's first production in a few years. Look out for more work over the next few months. We loves it!

With thanks to the Bristol Ferry Company http://www.bristolferry.com/
