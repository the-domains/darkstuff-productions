We would like to invite you to a water bound evening of chaos, confetti and cake aboard Bristol Ferry's MATILDA. Step aboard for a theatrical journey up the Avon as a guest at the wedding reception from hell! As the drinks flow and the speeches over-run a newlyweds' big night hits choppy waters when four attendees not only rock the boat but threaten to capsize the whole wedding reception.

A darkly comic new play packed with drunken speeches, bad singing and some truly terrible behaviour..

to have the musical talents of the creative polymath entity that is Rarg on board for the ride.

Darkstuff returns to Bristol with it's first production in a few years and we're joined by the musical talents of our favourite creative polymath [Rarg][1]. 

Look out for more work over the next few months, we have a few new adventures to unveil. You'll find it at all here.

We loves it!

With thanks to the Bristol Ferry Company http://www.bristolferry.com/
